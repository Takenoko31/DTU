# DTU

Random files are uploaded. Now it's really messy, but sometimes later it'll be improved.
Some are network analysis of twitter and headlines of "The Gurdean"(but a few files are just homework...), others are codes for classifocation of arm trajectories.
File named as "fireworks" is an animation of fireworks.(processing was used.)
File named as "wave equation" and "heat equation" are literaly simulations of wave and heat equation.

If you would like to see how the processing codes work, Processing might have to be downloaded in your computer.
